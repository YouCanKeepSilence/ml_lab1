# ML Labs
## Repository for ML labs in HSE
- [x] 1) Just play with dataset and make some simple calculations like use kNN method
- [x] 2) Try to decrease num of variables using PCA method and after that compare acquricy with and without them
- [x] 3) Create neural network (1-2 hidden layers) and try to fit it on our dataset. Try different count of neurons and different value of l2 regularization param.
- [x] 4) Use PCA method before pass data to the neural network (all other the same with lab #3)
